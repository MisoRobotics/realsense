## Installation Instructions

Assuming that ROS Kinetic has already been installed following the instructions at http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu, the steps below can be used to compile these ROS nodes for RealSense:
```bash
$ echo 'deb "http://jenkinsperc01.iil.intel.com:8080/userContent/freight" xenial main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/realsense-internal-latest.list
$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 8DF880DF
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install librealsense-all-dev
$ mkdir â€“p catkin_ws/src
$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ git clone http://github.intel.com/IntelRealSense/realsense_ros
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

**Note**: These instructions above currently use a different librealsense than provided publically as part of the ROS build farm.  Do not install ros-kinetic-realsense-camera or ros-kinetic-librealsense, otherwise the steps above will not work correctly. 

## Usage Instructions
See 'script_setup.sh' in this repo to install everything needed from scratch, from clean Ubuntu install
```bash
$ wget https://github.intel.com/raw/IntelRealSense/realsense_ros/master/script_setup.sh
$ chmod a+x ./script_setup.sh
$ ./script_setup.sh
```

**Note** Ensure no other apt/apt-get/aptd processes are running int the background.  In future, would like to use aptdcon to queue updates behind other running processes, or add shell script support for waiting for other commands to complete before proceeding
